# Job Portal

A **Job Portal** application built with React.js and Node.js that allows job seekers to find jobs, apply for positions, and manage their applications. Employers can post jobs, view applicants, and manage listings. The platform includes automated features using **node-cron** for scheduled tasks.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Component-based UI.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing.
- **Axios**: For API requests.
- **Material-UI/Chakra UI/Bootstrap**: Pre-built UI components for styling.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing users, jobs, and applications.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB.
- **JWT**: For secure authentication.
- **Node-Cron**: Automation and scheduling tasks.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-portal.git
   cd job-portal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the `.env` file:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.

## Automation with Node-Cron

The application uses **node-cron** for automating backend tasks:

1. **Job Expiry**:
   - Runs daily at midnight to check for expired jobs.
   - Automatically archives or deletes jobs based on their expiration date.

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - Sends weekly job recommendations to job seekers based on their preferences.
   - Notifies recruiters of new applicants.

3. **Database Cleanup**:
   - Removes old or inactive data every week to maintain database performance.

### Example Node-Cron Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example of how `node-cron` is set up in the backend:

```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const Job = require('./models/Job');

// Archive expired jobs daily
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('Running job expiry automation...');
  const today = new Date();
  await Job.updateMany({ expiryDate: { $lt: today } }, { status: 'archived' });
  console.log('Expired jobs archived.');
});

// Send weekly email notifications
cron.schedule('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  console.log('Sending weekly email notifications...');
  // Logic to fetch users and send emails
  console.log('Emails sent.');
});
```

---

## Scripts

- **Start Development Server**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Build Production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **Run Backend Tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

---

## Deployment

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Set up a hosting service like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS for deployment.
3. Configure environment variables on the hosting platform.
4. Deploy the backend and frontend.
